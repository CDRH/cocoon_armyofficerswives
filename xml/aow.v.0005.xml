<p>Though most women acknowledged the difficulty of establishing and maintaining social ties with whomever was posted to the garrison, they also embraced the Army as a broad and interesting family.  <persName rend="bio" reg="Burt, Elizabeth Reynolds" key="burt.e">Elizabeth Burt</persName> wrote that her family received assistance when traveling across eastern <placeName rend="State\Territory" reg="Wyoming">Wyoming</placeName> to a new assignment, because it was "in the Army where one finds the closest ties of friendship.

<p>Army wives defined a place for women in the Army and created a comfortable role that balanced their own interests, the needs of their husbands, and the peculiarities of life in the frontier Army.  If they found an Army marriage too personally restrictive and too materially limited, they had compensations in their friendships, motherhood, participation in Army policy and decisions, and their freedom to ride, hunt, shoot, fish, and otherwise enjoy the <placeName rend="Region" reg="Great Plains">Plains</placeName> before settlement.</p>
