<p>
Though dozens of Army officers' wives followed their husbands to large and small posts on the <placeName rend="Region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</placeName>, only a few left letters, journals, or memoirs.  Some of the officers' wives published books about their experiences with the hope of adding to their income, or to secure a proud history of their husband's service. Others wrote memoirs for their families, or scholars discovered their diaries years later and published them.</p>

<p>
The women listed in these pages are those whose memoirs and letters contain elegant descriptions of Army life, the <placeName rend="Region" reg="Great Plains">Plains</placeName> environment, and their opinions of military policy and relations with Indians.  Most of these women were married to men who served as officers of the Union Army during the Civil War.  Some of the officers gained their military experience and rank in the War, while others were graduates of West Point.  Many, such as <persName reg="Custer, George Armstrong">George Armstrong Custer</persName>, had received brevet or field promotions during the war.  <persName reg="Custer, George Armstrong">Custer</persName>, a brevet Major General, ultimately achieved the rank of Lt. Colonel, but was usually addressed as General, though that rank did not prevail after the U.S. Army was re-constituted after the war.</p>

He had re-enlisted after the Civil War as a First Lieutenant in 1866, and the early years of their marriage were marked by the difficulties of living uncomfortably on a lieutenant's pay.  Their only child, <persName reg="Baldwin, Juanita">Juanita</persName>, was born late in 1867. <persName rend="bio" reg="Baldwin, Alice Blackwood"  key="baldwin.a">Allie</persName> and <persName reg="Baldwin, Juanita">Nita</persName> often lived in Michigan with relatives because <persName reg="Baldwin, Frank">Frank</persName>'s pay could not support them as well as she wished.  <persName reg="Baldwin, Frank">Frank</persName> retired from the Army in 1906 and died in 1923.  <persName rend="bio" reg="Baldwin, Alice Blackwood"  key="baldwin.a">Allie</persName> tried to publish his memoirs, but did not find a publisher until 1929.
